\textsc{May '16 - May '17} & Student Researcher, \textbf{Information Sciences Institute} \\
& \small{Worked with Dr. Kevin Knight in the Natural Language Group. Developed a tool to perform unsupervised Optical Character Recognition on historical cipher images to aid automatic translation from images to English.}\\

\textsc{Aug '15 - May '17} & Student Researcher, \textbf{iLab at USC} \\
& \small{Worked with Dr. Laurent Itti on a project to autonomously detect surprising/unusual events from surveillance videos. Bayesian inference is used on frames to first detect surprising event and then a Convolutional Neural Network is used for modeling appearance to tag entities. Latest project focused on using deep recurrent networks for Human Attention Modeling.}\\

\textsc{May '14 - July '14 } & Software Development Intern, \textbf{Samsung Research Institute} \\
& \small{Worked on development of an android application for collision avoidance in vehicles. Used Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons to transmit GPS data (through smartphones placed inside the car). Estimated the future trajectories of the vehicles in the vicinity using GPS data from beacon signals to calculate the probability of collision.}\\
