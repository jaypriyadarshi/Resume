\textsc{May '16 - Current} & Student Researcher, \textbf{Information Sciences Institute} \\
& \small{Working with Dr. Kevin Knight in the Natural Language Group. Developed a tool to perform unsupervised Optical Character Recognition on images to automatically translate historical ciphers to English. Current project focuses on automatically decoding code language used by people on social media to avoid censorship}\\
\small{Tech stack} &\footnotesize{\textbf{Python, OpenCV, Machine Learning, AI}} \\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\textsc{Aug '15 - Current} & Student Researcher, \textbf{iLab at USC} \\
& \small{Working with Dr. Laurent Itti on a project to autonomously detect surprising/unusual events from surveillance videos. Bayesian inference is used on frames to first detect surprising event and then a Convolutional Neural Network is used for modeling appearance to tag entities.}\\
\small{Tech stack} &\footnotesize{\textbf{Python, TensorFlow, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI, OpenCV}} \\

\textsc{May '14 - July '14 } & Software Development Intern, \textbf{Samsung Research Institute} \\
& \small{Worked on development of an android application for collision avoidance in vehicles. Used Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons to transmit GPS data (through smartphones placed inside the car). Estimated the future trajectories of the vehicles in the vicinity using GPS data from beacon signals to calculate the probability of collision.}\\
