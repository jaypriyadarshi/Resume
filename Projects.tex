 - Alexa Skill for Amazon Echo device to generate poetry on demand using Alexa Skills Kit(ASK)\\
 - The developed node.js script (hosted on AWS Lambda function) makes an API call to retreive generated poem(using Recurrent Neural Net) for a user-requested topic and uses Alexa service to render text to speech

  \item \textbf{Sentimental Analysis using Distributed Representations} | \href{https://bitbucket.org/jaypriyadarshi/sentiment-analysis}{bitbucket.org/jaypriyadarshi/sentiment-analysis} | \textbf{Python, Machine Learning}\\
 - Used Word2Vec and Doc2vec features and Logistic Regression as a classifier to perform sentimental analysis of Arabic (Morphologically rich) and Mandarin (less morphology) book reviews\\
 - Built a crawler for retreiving book reviews from goodreads.com and a n-gram baseline for comparison\\
 - Achieved 84\% and 76\% using Word2Vec and 83\% and 74\% using Doc2Vec on Arabic and Mandarin data
