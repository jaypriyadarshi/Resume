\section{Relevant Projects}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Neural Network Library} | \href{https://github.com/jaypriyadarshi/NeuralNet}{github.com/jaypriyadarshi/NeuralNet} | \textbf{Python, Machine Learning}\\
 - An optimized modular neural network library with fully vectorized implementation using numpy\\
 - Supports Batch Normalization, Dropout, ReLU, Max pooling, Fully Connected and Convolutional layers\\
 - Supports Stochastic Gradient Descent (vanilla and momentum), RMSprop and ADAM\\
 - Includes Softmax and SVM loss functions\\
 - Trained a Seven Layer Convolution Network, achieved 83.6\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset

 %\item \textbf{QuickFoods} \\ This is an innovative app for hotels to manage their orders with ease even in rush hours. It mainly aims at reducting the time taken to complete the order cycle by bridging the gap between waiters and kitchen. This was built in Intuit LABS and received a lot traction from several five star hotels.

 \item \textbf{Stock Viewer} | \href{https://github.com/jaypriyadarshi/Stock_Market_Viewer}{github.com/jaypriyadarshi/Stock\_Market\_Viewer} | \textbf{PHP, Ajax, jQuery, Android, CSS}\\
 - A Web Application to get stock information (current and past) for any company with good data visualizations\\
 - Stock Data is retreived from a server hosted on AWS\\
 - Used Highcharts API to visualize the stock data and Bing API to retrieve recent news for the queried company\\
 - Developed an Android App to serve the above web application functions as a mobile application

 \item \textbf{Poem Generator} | \href{https://github.com/jaypriyadarshi/Alexa-Skill-for-Poem-generation}{github.com/jaypriyadarshi/Alexa-Skill-for-Poem-generation} | \textbf{node.js, Alexa Skills Kit}\\
 - Alexa Skill for Amazon Echo device to generate poetry on demand using Alexa Skills Kit(ASK)\\
 - The developed node.js script (hosted on AWS Lambda function) makes an API call to retreive generated poem(using Recurrent Neural Net) for a user-requested topic and uses Alexa service to render text to speech

  \item \textbf{Sentimental Analysis using Distributed Representations} | \href{https://bitbucket.org/jaypriyadarshi/sentiment-analysis}{bitbucket.org/jaypriyadarshi/sentiment-analysis} | \textbf{Python, Machine Learning}\\
 - Used Word2Vec and Doc2vec features and Logistic Regression as a classifier to perform sentimental analysis of Arabic (Morphologically rich) and Mandarin (less morphology) book reviews\\
 - Built a crawler for retreiving book reviews from goodreads.com and a n-gram baseline for comparison\\
 - Achieved 84\% and 76\% using Word2Vec and 83\% and 74\% using Doc2Vec on Arabic and Mandarin data
 %\item \textbf{Social Event Detection} | \href{http://github.com/alseambusher/SED}{github.com/alseambusher/SED}\\
 %I built a python based tool that can automatically detect social events using Multimodal clustering. I obtained event-related miltimodal multimedia and organized them in event-specific clusters. This approach essentially achieves “supervised fusion” of hetrogeneous features and retrieves clusters that are related to social events.

 %\item \textbf{A Real Time Multiplayer Gaming Network Platform as a Service} - As multiplayer games are becoming more and more complex, there is a need of a simpler way for game developers to manage network. I built a network framework in C++ and Python using which issues such as latency, load balancing, bad connectivity etc. can be addressed through a service.\\
