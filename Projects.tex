\item \textbf{Poem Generator} | \href{https://github.com/jaypriyadarshi/Alexa-Skill-for-Poem-generation}{github.com/jaypriyadarshi/Alexa-Skill-for-Poem-generation} | \textbf{node.js, Alexa Skills Kit}\\
 - Alexa Skill for Amazon Echo device to generate poetry on demand using Alexa Skills Kit(ASK)\\
 - The developed node.js script (hosted on AWS Lambda function) makes an API call to retreive generated poem(using Recurrent Neural Net) for a user-requested topic and uses Alexa service to render text to speech

 \item \textbf{Human Attention Modeling} | \href{https://github.com/jaypriyadarshi/AttentionModeling}{github.com/jaypriyadarshi/AttentionModeling} | \textbf{Python, Tensorflow}\\
 - Learning features that attracts attention for 6 neurological groups (CTRL, ALS, AD/MCI, PARKINSON, FTD, VCI) from the Eye Tracker data collected by participants watching video clips\\
 - Recurrent Neural Network was trained on "What" + "Where" features. "What" features indicate the saliency features from a video frame calculated from the saliency maps. "Where" features indicate the region of the video frame that attracted a participant's attention
